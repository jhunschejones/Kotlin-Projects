# Alpas Todolist

## Overview
This is a small web app that I built using Kotlin and the Alpas framework, starting from their provided [quickstart guide](https://alpas.dev/docs/quick-start-guide-todo-list).

## Lessons learned
Alpas seems like a really interesting way to get up and running quickly with Kotlin for the web. Getting everything to play well in InteliJ was a bit of a struggle, and I ended up editing the templates and assets using VSCode instead. The framework has some neat scripts built right in which helped me set up important components like controllers, models, and database migrations. I don't see this framework replacing my go-to tools anytime soon, but I would give this a shot on a greenfield app in the future, especially if using the JVM was a project requirement.
